    <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I've been around technology all my life, due to my parents often needing help with their phones or computer. 
            My interest in technology started when I was young playing video games with my older brother. 
            I would be able to watch him play for hours and learn from what he did to get better at the game than him. </p>
        <p>Software Development isn't just a job to me, It'a a liftstyle, I chose tto take this path by making the 
            world a better place.
            helping people is my pasion and I know I can do great things in this wrold, that is why I chose this career path.
        </p>
